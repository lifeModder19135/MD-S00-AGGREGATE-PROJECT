# MD-S00-AGGREGATE-PROJECT
MD-APP-AGGREGATE-PROJECT

This repo is reserved as a place to store _PROD_ phase services. It will serve as a tool for:

    - Checking the breadth of the in-production architecture at any given time (at least until all services have been deployed.)
    - It will (ideally) serve as a hub / base point for various automation pipelines (for CI/CD, Testing, etc.) using Github Workflows.
    - Show, at a glance, which services are ready for beta launch.
    
To this end, Only Services that have passed target tests and been approved as 'ready-to-launch' will go here. 

### VERSIONING:

A seperate fork will be created for each Version of the M&D Build, starting with V 0.0.1.   Each fork will be archived with only those services which were included in that version of the application.
